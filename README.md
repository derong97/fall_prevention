## Problem Statement
1. To automatically detect posture changes of high-fall-risk patients during independent toileting, so that nurses can intervene in a timely manner to prevent potential falls in ward toilets.
2. To develop a post-monitoring platform that logs the toileting activities of every high-fall-risk patient and provides insights based on collected data, so that nurses can understand their patientsâ€™ needs and manage their own time better.
